## Features ‚ú®

- **Season 2 Boost & 1.25x Earnings:** Enjoy enhanced earnings with the latest Season 2 update!
- **WebSocket Connection via SOCKS Proxies:** Securely connect using the SOCKS5 protocol.
- **Multiple User IDs:** Manage several Get Grass accounts simultaneously with multiple proxies.
- **High Earning Potential:** Each proxy (‚âà 3000 $GRASS Points per day) maximizes your daily earnings.
- **Cost Efficiency:** As per Stage 1 Airdrop data, 1M Grass Points roughly equals 45 GRASS tokens (Bonus Epooch not included).
- **Data Usage Efficiency:** Approximately 2 GB of proxy data yields 1M points, meaning ~$6 spent on proxies produces around 45 GRASS tokens.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The script automatically manages errors such as dead proxies, SSL errors (e.g., WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER), invalid packed IP addresses, empty connect replies, and internal errors (sent 1011 keepalive). Dead proxies are automatically removed from the file.

  ```
- **VPS Server:**  
  Options include AWS free tier, Google Cloud free tier, or any affordable VPS (~$2-5/month).
- **Proxy Server:**  
  **Important:** Use only ISP Residential Proxies to earn $GRASS tokens; data center or cheap proxies will result in 0% earnings.
- **Recommended Proxy Provider:**  
  Use [Proxies.fo](https://app.proxies.fo/ref/b260731b-9a88-fc8c-415a-7024f3824a27). Purchase the ISP plan (not the residential plan) for optimal performance.

4. **Generate SOCKS5 Proxies:**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51e6e2a4-cccc-47f7-88cb-65548445fcd4)

   Add the generated proxies to the `proxy.txt` file in the following format:
   ```
   socks5://username:pass@ip:port
   OR
   socks://username:pass@ip:port
   ```

   Alternatively, you can specify the proxy file path using the `-p` or `--proxy-file` command-line argument when running the script:
   ```bash
   python run.py -p your_proxy_file.txt
   ```

## Steps to Run the Code ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed and all necessary packages.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/budgetbanter/GrassBot
   ```
2. **Change Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd GrassBot
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Enter Your User ID and Proxy Count:**  
   You will be prompted to enter your `UserID` and the number of proxies you wish to use.
5. **Add Your Proxies:**  
   Add your proxies to the `proxy.txt` file. You can add 10,000+ proxies!  
   **Format:**
   ```bash
   socks5://username:pass@ip:port
   OR
   socks://username:pass@ip:port
   ```
7. **Multiple Proxies:**  
   Each IP is estimated to earn ~3000 $GRASS per day.
8. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
9. **Multiple User IDs:**  
   To run multiple User IDs, add them to the `config.json` file.
   *Format for `config.json`:*
   ```json
   {
    "user_ids": [
        "USER_ID_1",
        "USER_ID_2"
    ]
   }
   ```

### NOTE:

Approximately 2GB of proxy data yields about 45 $GRASS tokens (around $90), based on past trends and Stage 1 user data.

Happy mining and good luck maximizing your earnings! üí∞üî•
